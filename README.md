Optimizing the distribution of components (using genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic) within an aircraft hold while meeting various constraints such as non-overlapping or center of gravity is within the allowable range

The center of gravity affects the stability of the aircraft. To ensure the aircraft is safe to fly, the center of gravity must fall within specified limits established by the aircraft manufacturer. The aim of the project was to optimize the distribution of components within an aircraft hold while meeting various constraints such as non-overlapping or center of gravity is within the allowable range. To achieve this, an application was developed (using genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic) to find a near optimal solution to this problem.

Technologies used: C# and .NET Framework
